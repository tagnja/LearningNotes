### Counting 1's Occur Times from Binary of a Number

```java
public int getOneOccurTimesOfNumber(int n){
	int count = 0;
    while(n > 0){
        n = n & (n-1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;    
}
```



### Judging the parity of a Number

```java
public boolean isEven(int number){
	return (number & 0x1 == 0);
} 
```
