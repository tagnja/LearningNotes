### Find the Number of  Islands

#### Description

Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands

**Example:**

```
Input : mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
                   {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
                   {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
                   {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                   {1, 0, 1, 0, 1} 
Output : 5
```

This is a variation of the standard problem: “Counting the number of connected components in an undirected graph”.

#### Solutions

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

#define ROW 5
#define COL 5

void DFS(int mat[][COL], bool visited[][COL], int i, int j)
{
	if (i >= 0 && i < ROW && j >= 0 && j < COL && ! visited[i][j] && mat[i][j] == 1)
	{
		visited[i][j] = true;
		DFS(mat, visited, i-1, j);
		DFS(mat, visited, i+1, j);
		DFS(mat, visited, i, j-1);
		DFS(mat, visited, i, j+1);
		DFS(mat, visited, i-1, j-1);
		DFS(mat, visited, i-1, j+1);
		DFS(mat, visited, i+1, j+1);
		DFS(mat, visited, i+1, j-1);
	}
	
	return;
}

int solution(int mat[][COL])
{
	bool visited[ROW][COL];
	memset(visited, 0, sizeof visited);
	
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < ROW; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < COL; j++)
		{
			if (mat[i][j] && ! visited[i][j])
			{
				count++;
				DFS(mat, visited, i, j);
			}
		}
	}
	return count;
}

int main()
{
	int mat[][COL] = { { 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }, 
                     { 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 }, 
                     { 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 }, 
                     { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }, 
                     { 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 } };
	
	cout << "Number of islands is: " << solution(mat); // Number of islands is: 5 
	return 0;
}
```

### Transitive Closure of a Graph

#### Description

Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u for all vertex pairs (u, v) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex u to v. The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.

```
For example, consider below graph
     1 1 1 0
     0 1 1 0 
     1 0 1 1 
     0 0 0 1 
Transitive closure of above graphs is 
     1 1 1 1 
     1 1 1 1 
     1 1 1 1 
     0 0 0 1 
```

#### Solutions

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

#define V 4

void DFS(int mat[][V], int visited[][V], int curr, int X)
{
	for (int j = 0; j < V; j++)
	{
		visited[curr][j] = 1;
		if (j != curr && j != X && mat[curr][j] == 1)
		{
			mat[X][j] = 1;
			if (! visited[j][0])
			{
				DFS(mat, visited, j, X);
			}
		}
	}
}

void solution(int mat[][V])
{
	int visited[V][V];
	
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
	{
		memset(visited, 0, sizeof visited);
		DFS(mat, visited, i, i);
	}
	return;
}

int main()
{
	int mat[V][V] = { { 1, 1, 1, 0}, 
					{ 0, 1, 1, 0}, 
					{ 1, 0, 1, 1}, 
					{ 0, 0, 0, 1}};
	/*
	
	Output:
		Transitive closure matrix is 
		1 1 1 1 
		1 1 1 1 
		1 1 1 1 
		0 0 0 1 
	*/
	
	solution(mat);
	
	cout << "Transitive closure matrix is " << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < V; j++)
		{
			cout << mat[i][j] << " ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}
	cout << endl;
	return 0;
}

// T(n) = O(n^3), S(n) = O(n^2)
```
