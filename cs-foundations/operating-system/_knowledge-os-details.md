### Main



### I. Overview



<h3 id="intr">1. Introduction</h3>



#### What Operating System Do ~

> Computer System divided component: hardware, operating system, application programs, users.



User View

- The user's view is  according to the interface. Like GUI, terminal.
- For a PC of single-user, the operating system is designed for ease of use. The goal is to maximize the work (or play). performance is important rather than resource utilization.
- For mainframe, It is designed to maximize resource utilization.
- For workstation, it is designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization.



System View

- An operating system as a resource allocator. Managing CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O device, and so on.
- How to allocate resource efficiently and fairly to specific programs and users
- A slightly view of an operating system is a control program. It manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.



Defining Operating Systems

- An operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being systems programs and application programs.
- An operating system like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. 



#### Computer-System Organization ~



Computer System Organization

- A computer system consist of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory.

- How a computer to start running? An initial program bootstrap program. It is stored in read-only memory (ROM). It locate and load operating system into memory. 

- A modern computer system

  ```
                   disks           mouse  keyboard  printer         monitor
                    |                  \     |     /                   |   
  CPU         disk controller          USE controller           graphics adapter
  |_________________|________________________|_________________________|
                                |
                              memory
  ```

  

Computer-System Operation - interrupt

- What is it? When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfer execution to a fixed location. Example, CPU is waiting I/O operation, when I/O data transfer done, need to interrupt the CPU to continue execute next instruction of program.
- Trigger an interrupt. Hardware by sending a signal to the CPU by way of system bus. Software by executing a system call.



Storage Structure

- Storage-device hierarchy

  ```
  # Speed, cost, size top-down
  
  register
  cache
  main memory
  ----------------------------------
  electronic disk    (nonvolatile)
  magnetic disk 
  optical disk
  magnetic tapes
  ```
