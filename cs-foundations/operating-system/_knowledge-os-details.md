### Main



### I. Overview



<h3 id="intr">1. Introduction</h3>

> Computer System vs Operating System
>
> Computer System: Hardware and software perspective for computer. Mainly in hardware organization.
>
> Operating System: Hardware and software perspective for operating system. Mainly in operating system functions.

#### What Operating System Do ~

> Computer System divided component: hardware, operating system, application programs, users.



User View

- The user's view is  according to the interface. Like GUI, terminal.
- For a PC of single-user, the operating system is designed for ease of use. The goal is to maximize the work (or play). performance is important rather than resource utilization.
- For mainframe, It is designed to maximize resource utilization.
- For workstation, it is designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization.



System View

- An operating system as a resource allocator. Managing CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O device, and so on.
- How to allocate resource efficiently and fairly to specific programs and users
- A slightly view of an operating system is a control program. It manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.



Defining Operating Systems

- An operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being systems programs and application programs.
- An operating system like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. 



#### Computer-System Organization ~



##### Computer System Organization

- A computer system consist of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory.

- How a computer to start running? An initial program bootstrap program. It is stored in read-only memory (ROM). It locate and load operating system into memory. 

- A modern computer system

  ```
                   disks           mouse  keyboard  printer         monitor
                    |                  \     |     /                   |   
  CPU         disk controller          USE controller           graphics adapter
  |_________________|________________________|_________________________|
                                |
                              memory
  ```

  

##### Computer-System Operation - interrupt

- What is it? When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfer execution to a fixed location. Example, CPU is waiting I/O operation, when I/O data transfer done, need to interrupt the CPU to continue execute next instruction of program.
- Trigger an interrupt. Hardware by sending a signal to the CPU by way of system bus. Software by executing a system call.



##### Storage Structure

- Storage-device hierarchy

  ```
  # Speed, cost, size top-down
  
  register
  cache
  main memory
  ----------------------------------
  electronic disk    (nonvolatile)
  magnetic disk 
  optical disk
  magnetic tapes
  ```

- cache (RAM memory)



##### I/O Structure

- system bus

  - The system bus is a pathway composed of cables and connectors used to carry data between a computer microprocessor and the main memory.
  - The bus provides a communication path for the data and control signals moving between the major components of computer system.
  - Three main buses: data, address and control bus.
  - computer system consists of CUPs and multiple device controllers that are connected through a common bus.

- device driver

  - it understands device controller.
  - It presents a uniform  interface to the device to the operating system.

- device controller

  - it's in charge of a specific type of device. 
  - Devices attached to specific controller.
  - It maintains some local buffer storage (in RAM) and a set of special-purpose registers.
  - It is responsible for moving data between peripheral devices that it controls and its local buffer storage.

- buffer (buffer storage)

  - A part of RAM used for temporary storage of data that is waiting to be sent to a device (or read from device).
  - it is a data area shared by hardware devices or program processes.

- interrupt-driven I/O

  - device driver loads registers within device controller
  - device controller execute appropriate task by contents of these registers.
  - controller transfer of data from device to its local buffer (in RAM).
  - controller informs device driver via an interrupt that it has finished its operation.
  - device driver return control to OS. returning data pointer(read) or status information(write).

- DMA(direct memory access)

  - device controller transfer an entire block of data directly to or from its buffer storage to memory, with no intervention by CPU.
  - interrupt is generated per block.

- How a modern computer system works

  ```
  -------------------------------                            --------------------
  | Thread of execution |       |  <----instruction ----->   |   instructions   |
  |                     | cache |     execution cycle        |       and        | 
  |   CPU(*N)           |       |  <----data movement---->   |      data        |

     |          ^         ^                            /     |                  |
     |          |         |                       /          |      memory      |
  IO REQUEST   data    interrupt             /                --------------------
     |          |         |             DMA
     V          V         |           /
  --------------------------       /

#### Computer-System Architecture

Single-Processor Systems

Multiprocessor Systems

Clustered Systems



#### Operating-System Structure ~

Operating system structure

- Multiprogramming
  - increasing CPU utilization by organization jobs.
  - keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously.
  - CPU is switched executing jobs in job pool.
- Time sharing
  - It is a logical extension of multiprogramming.
  - It allows many users to share the computer simultaneously.
- Process
  - a program loaded into memory and executing is called a process.
- Job scheduling, job pool.
- CPU scheduling
- Memory swapping
- Virtual memory



#### Operating-System Operations ~

##### trap

- a trap (or an exception) is a signal like an interrupt.
- It is a software-generated interrupt caused by an error (for example, division by zero or invalid memory access) or by a specific request from a user program.



##### Dual-Mode Operation

- Ensure proper execution of the operating system, must to distinguish between execution of operating system code and user program code.
- A bit called mode bit is added to the hardware of the computer indicate the current mode: kernel(0) or user(1).
- privileged instructions
  - Privileged instructions executed only in kernel mode. If an attempt execute a privileged instruction in user mode, the hardware does not execute rather treats it as illegal and traps it to operating system.
  - Privileged instruction: I/O control, timer management, interrupt management.
  - user program execute privileged instructions by send a system call to operating system.
- Life cycle of instruction execution
  - initial control is within operating system, where instructions are executed in kernel mode.
  - when control is given to a user application, mode is set to user mode.
  - control is switched back to operating system, when an interrupt, a trap, or a system call is occurred.

##### Timer

- Using a timer to prevent a user program from getting stuck in an infinite loop or never returning control to the operating system.
- A timer can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period.
