### Java EE

<h3 id="wije"># What is Java EE</h3>

What is Java EE

- It translates to Java Enterprise Edition.

- **Java EE is a collection of specifications for developing and deploying enterprise applications.** (In general, enterprise applications refer to software hosted on servers that provide the applications that support the enterprise. The specifications (defined by Sun) describe services, application programming interfaces (APIs), and protocols. The Java EE product provider is typically an application-server, web-server, or database-system vendor who provides classes that implement the interfaces defined in the specifications. These vendors compete on implementations of the Java EE specifications.)

- **Java EE is actually a collection of technologies and APIs** for the Java platform designed to support "Enterprise" Applications which can generally be classed as large-scale, distributed, transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements. Transactions and distribution are key.

- Java EE is indeed an **abstract** specification. Anybody is open to develop and provide a working implementation of the specification. The *concrete* implementations are the so-called application servers, like [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/), [TomEE](http://tomee.apache.org/), [GlassFish](http://glassfish.org/), [Liberty](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/appserv-was-liberty-core), [WebLogic](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index.html), etc. There are also servlet containers which implement only the JSP/Servlet part of the huge Java EE API, such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/), etc.

  We, Java EE developers, should write code utilizing the specification (i.e. import *only* `javax.*`classes in our code instead of implementation specific classes such as `org.jboss.wildfly.*`, `com.sun.glassfish.*`, etc) and then we'll be able to run our code on any implementation (thus, on any application server). If you're familiar with JDBC, it's basically the same concept as how JDBC drivers work. See also a.o. [In simplest terms, what is a factory?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7550612/in-simplest-terms-what-is-a-factory)

The 13 core technologies that make up Java EE are:

1. JDBC
2. JNDI
3. EJBs
4. RMI
5. JSP
6. Java Servlets
7. XML
8. JMS
9. Java IDL
10. JTS
11. JTA
12. JavaMail
13. JAF

<h3 id="eas"># Are EJB/Spring different implementations of Java EE?</h3>

Are EJB/Spring different implementations of Java EE?

- No. EJB is part of Java EE. Spring is a standalone framework which substitutes and improves many parts of Java EE. Spring doesn't necessarily require Java EE to run. A barebones servletcontainer like Tomcat is already sufficient. Simply put, Spring is a competitor of Java EE. E.g. "Spring" (standalone) competes EJB/JTA, Spring MVC competes JSF/JAX-RS, Spring DI/IoC/AOP competes CDI, Spring Security competes JAAS/JASPIC, etc.
- Back during the old J2EE/EJB2 times, the EJB2 API was terrible to implement and maintain. Spring was then a much better alternative to EJB2. But since EJB3 (Java EE 5), the EJB API was much improved based on lessons learnt from Spring. Since CDI (Java EE 6), there's not really a reason to look at again *another* framework like Spring to make the developers more easy as to developing among others the service layer.
- Only when you're using a barebones servletcontainer such as Tomcat and can't move on to a Java EE server, then Spring is more attractive as it's easier to install Spring on Tomcat. It isn't possible to install e.g. an EJB container om Tomcat without modifying the server itself, you would basically be reinventing TomEE.

### Servlet/JSP

<h3 id="wis"># What is Servlet</h3>

What is Servlet

- Servlet is a technology i.e. used to create web application.
- Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create dynamic web page. 
- Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentations.
- Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any servlet.
- Servlet is a class that extend the capabilities of the servers and respond to the incoming request. It can respond to any type of requests.
- A servlet is simply a class which responds to a particular type of network request - most commonly an HTTP request. Basically servlets are usually used to implement web applications - but there are also various frameworks which operate on top of servlets (e.g. Struts) to give a higher-level abstraction than the "here's an HTTP request, write to this HTTP response" level which servlets provide.

<h3 id="los"># Lifecycle of Servlet</h3>

Lifecycle of Servlet

- Servlet class loaded.
- Servlet instance created.
- init() method is invoked. Initializes the servlet.
- service() method invoked.
- destroy() method invoked.

<h3 id="for"># Flow of Request</h3>

Flow of request

- Client sends HTTP request to Web server
- Web server forwards that HTTP request to web container.
- Since Servlet can not understand HTTP, its a Java program, it only understands objects, so web container converts that request into valid request object
- Web container spins a thread for each request
- All the business logic goes inside doGet() or doPost() callback methods inside the servlets
- Servlet builds a Java response object and sends it to the container. It converts that to HTTP response again to send it to the client

**How does the Container know which Servlet client has requested for?**

- There’s a file called web.xml
- This is the master file for a web container
- You have information about servlet in this file-
  - servlets
    - Servlet-name
    - Servlet-class
  - servlet-mappings \- the path like /Login or /Notifications is mapped here in
    - Servlet-name
    - url-pattern
  - and so on
- Every servlet in the web app should have an entry into this file
- So this lookup happens like- url-pattern -> servlet-name -> servlet-class

<h3 id="til"># Transaction Isolation Levels</h3>



| Level                | **dirty reads** | **non-repeatable reads** | **phantom reads** |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **READ_UNCOMMITTED** | yes             | yes                      | yes               |
| **READ_COMMITTED**   | no              | yes                      | yes               |
| **REPEATABLE_READ**  | no              | no                       | yes               |
| **SERIALIZABLE**     | no              | no                       | no                |

READ_UNCOMMITTED: 读未提交，即能够读取到没有被提交的数据.
READ_COMMITTED: 读已提交，即能够读到那些已经提交的数据.
REPEATABLE_READ: 数据读出来之后加锁,防止别人修改它。
SERLALIZABLE: 串行化，最高的事务隔离级别，不管多少事务，挨个运行完一个事务的所有子事务之后才可以执行另外一个事务里面的所有子事务.

### Spring Framework

<h3 id="sta"># Spring Transaction accomplishment principles</h3>

- How @transactional work in spring?

### Spring Boot

### # What is Spring Boot

简化基于spring项目的配置。

### # Spring Boot features or goals

Advantages

- 简化配置，快速开始开发。没有繁琐的配置，专注于业务开发。

- 内置tomcat和jetty容器，可以直接启动。

- 没有代码生成和xml配置

Shortcomings

### # Spring Boot 实现原理

在pom.xml文件中把spring boot 作为parent父项目。

```java
	<!-- Inherit defaults from Spring Boot -->
	<parent>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
		<version>1.5.9.RELEASE</version>
		<relativePath/>
	</parent>
	
	<!-- Add typical dependencies for a web application -->
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
	
    <!-- Package as an executable jar -->
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
```

### # Spring Boot Configuration 

.properties or .yml

1).properties

```
app.user.name = javastack
```

2).yml

```
app:
    user:
        name: javastack
```
